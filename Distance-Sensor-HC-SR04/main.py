    This class represents the distance sensor HC-SR04. It can be used
    for many different projects and multiple times per one board.

    The HC-SR04 sends out an ultrasonic sound if the trigger is set.
    By measuring the time until the sound is bounced back by a wall and
    recognized by echo.

    This sensor has four pins. The first one is VCC and it should be
    wired to physical pin number 36 called "3V3(OUT)". The last pin
    is labeled GND and should be connected to one of the GND pins.
    The trigger pin should be labeled to a GPIO output pin and the
    echo pin to a GPIO input pin.
