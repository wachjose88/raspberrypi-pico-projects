# My Raspberry Pi Pico projects

This is a collection of my Raspberry Pi Pico projects.

Each project is placed in a directory and has its own Readme. Currently there
are the following projects:

- **Blinking LED**: This is a very simple project. It lets the integrated LED
blink.
- **Button LED Toggle**: This is a very simple project for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
It switches the integrated LED on and off if a physical button is pressed.
- **Distance Sensor HC-SR04**: This is a library and its usage for the distance sensor
HC-SR04. It measures the distance by using ultrasonic sounds.
