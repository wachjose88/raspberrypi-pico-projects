# Button LED Toggle

This is a very simple project for the Raspberry Pi Pico. It switches the
integrated LED on and off if a physical button is pressed. The LED remains on
while the button is held down.

Use a button which closes the circuit if it is
pressed down. Wire the button from the pin "3V3(OUT)" which is physical pin
number 36 to the pin "GP14" which is physical pin number 19.
